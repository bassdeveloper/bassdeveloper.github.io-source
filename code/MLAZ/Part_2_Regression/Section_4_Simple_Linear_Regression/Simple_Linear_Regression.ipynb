    "\n",
    "For a given company, 30 random people were selected and their **years of experience** and **salary** were recorded in a dataset. This dataset is going to be analyzed for our Simple Linear Regression model to discover if there is a some correlation between both salary and years of experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple linear regression model would tell us about the *best-fitting-line* for the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = b_0 + b_1*x_1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $y$ is the **dependent variable** and $x_1$ (or $x$ since there is only 1 variable) is the **independent variable**. $b_0$ (constant) and $b_1$ are the **Co-efficients**."
