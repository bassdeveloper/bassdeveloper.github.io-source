# IBM® Bluemix®
A cloud computing platform that **combines platform as a service (PaaS) with infrastructure as a service (IaaS)**.

* Polyglot (using several languages) programming approaches.

* No investment in Hardware Models, all is handled.

You can take an idea from

*inception, to development sandbox, to a globally distributed production environment*  

* IBM® Bluemix® also provides flexible deployment.

* Provision IBM® Bluemix® resources on-premises, in dedicated private cloud environments, or in the public cloud, and manage the resources from all three types of environments in a single dashboard.

* All IBM cloud resources that are deployed in public and dedicated environments are hosted from your choice of IBM® Cloud Data Center locations around the world.

* IBM Cloud Data Centers provide regional redundancy, a global network backbone connecting all data centers and points of presence, and stringent security controls and reporting.

IBM enables you to:

* Secure Data Centers

* Test and adopt to a broad range of services.

* Connect to all of your legacy systems and apps from a single, scalable, cloud platform through private network and API capabilities.

App Dashboard has everything.

## Boiler Plates :
Bluemix provides various boilerplates and runtimes:

> A boilerplate is a template for an application and its associated runtime environment and predefined services for a specific domain.

> A runtime is the set of resources that is used to run an app, provided as containers for different types of apps.

## Methods :
Bluemix provides various ways for you to run your apps, for example :

* Cloud Foundry and IBM® Bluemix® Container Service. (run Docker containers on cloud)

> Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries – anything that can be installed on a server. This guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of its environment.

* You can use IBM® Bluemix® OpenWhisk for distributed, event-driven computing.

OpenWhisk runs application logic in response to events or direct invocations from web or mobile apps over HTTP.

* Use Mobile Services

Services

The Services dashboard provides access to the Bluemix services :

* Fast + Cheap Apps from IBM DevOps services and the Bluemix Garage Method.

* Blockchain is a peer-to-peer distributed ledger technology for a new generation of transactional applications that establishes trust, accountability, and transparency while streamlining business processes.

* Watson gives your apps the power of cognitive computing with a full suite of speech, vision, and data APIs.

* IBM enables you to do more with rich, integrated cloud databases and Data & Analytics services.

* The IBM Internet of Things service lets your apps communicate with, and consume data that is collected by, your connected devices, sensors, and gateways. Our recipes make it easy to get devices connected to our Internet of Things cloud. Your apps can then use our real-time and REST APIs to communicate with your devices and consume the data you've set them up to collect.


IBM offers a mobile backend infrastructure where you can build multiplatform, native, or hybrid apps while also being able to monitor and test them. You can also enhance your app with analytics, security, user insight, and continuous delivery.
Bluemix also provides experimental services that you can try out. To learn about service types and availability, see Bluemix services.

Infrastructure

The Infrastructure dashboard provides various services to fit your cloud infrastructure needs.
