# Where's the Machine?

Lets start by looking at machine learning examples and application to get a broad picture of what we're going to discuss in the article.

1. Facebook Image Tagging and Facial Recognition.
2. Nintendo - Kinect Sports uses Random Forest
3. Virtual Reality
4. Speech-to-Text
5. Robot Dogs - Reinforcement Learning
6. Facebook Advertisements
7. Amazon, Audible recommender systems
8. Medical systems
9. Space Machine Learning
10. Expore unknown territories like Mars

## The Future

Why is Machine learning the future?

1 letter takes 1 byte of data. A page takes roughly 1KB of data. A 500 double-sided page notebook would take 1MB.
1GB = fits the Human Genome ~ about 725 MB of space.
80 years, filmed with an HD camera and you can fit the data in 1TB.

> Since the dawn of time till 2005, humans have created 130 Exabytes of data.

> 2010 - 1200 Exabytes
> 2015 - 7900 Exabytes
> 2020 - 40900 Exabytes (estimated)

Data is growing exponentially.

To use the data that is generated, we need to use Machine Learning algorithms since all the data needs to be examined and utilized.
