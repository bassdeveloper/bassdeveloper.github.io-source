# Think!!
IBM Watsonâ„¢ Knowledge Studio to
**Create a machine-learning model** that
* Understands the linguistic nuances,
* Meaning, and
* Relationships
Specific to your industry

Or

**Create a rule-based model** that finds entities in documents based on rules that you define.

To become a subject matter expert in a given industry or domain, Watson must be trained.

The task of training Watson can be facilitated by **Watson Knowledge Studio**.

## Build a machine-learning model :

Watson Knowledge Studio provides easy-to-use tools for
* **annotating unstructured domain literature**, and
* **uses those annotations to create a custom machine-learning model that understands the language of the domain**.

The accuracy of the model improves through
* **iterative testing**.

Ultimately resulting in an algorithm that can learn from the patterns that it sees and recognize those patterns in large collections of new documents.

The finished machine-learning model can be deployed to other solutions.

1. Based on a set of domain-specific source documents, the team creates a **type system that defines entity types and relation types** for the information of interest to the application that will use the model.

2. A group of 2 or more human annotators a small set of source documents to

* **label words that represent entity types**,
* to **identify relation types** where the text identifies relationships between entity mentions.
* to **define coreferences**, which identify different mentions that refer to the same thing, that is, the same entity.

3. The ground truth is used to train a model.

4. The trained model is used to find entities, relations, and coreferences in new, never-seen-before documents.

## Creating a machine-learning annotator :

Create a machine-learning annotator that trains a model you can use to *identify entities*, *coreferences*, and *relationships of interest* in new documents.
