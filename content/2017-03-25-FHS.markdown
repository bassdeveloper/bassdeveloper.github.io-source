# Filesystem

It is possible to define two independent distinctions among files :

1. Shareable v/s
2. Unshareable

and

1. Variable v/s
2. Static

**In general, files that differ in either of these respects should be located in different directories.**

This makes it easy to store files with different usage characteristics on different filesystems.

* "Shareable" files are those that can be stored on one host and used on others.

* "Unshareable" files are those that are not shareable.

For example, the files in user home directories are shareable whereas device lock files are not.

* "Static" files include binaries, libraries, documentation files and other files that do not change without system administrator intervention.

* "Variable" files are files that are not static.
