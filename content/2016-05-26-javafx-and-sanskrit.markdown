# JAVAFX

* The platform is made from the JAVA API. JavaFX applications can use Java API libraries to access native system capabilities and connect to server-based middleware applications.

* The look and feel of JavaFX applications can be customized using CSS. FXML helps in this.   
UI can be built without writing code using JavaFX scene builder.

* As the UI is designed, the Scene Builder creates FXML markup that can be ported to an IDE.
