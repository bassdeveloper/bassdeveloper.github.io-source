# `Cmake`

> `CMake` is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to **build, test and package** software.

CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and **compiler independent configuration files**, and generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice.
