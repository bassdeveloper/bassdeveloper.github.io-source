# Qubit

## Pre-requisites :

* **Hilbert Space** :

Generalizes the notion of *Euclidean space*. It extends the methods of *vector algebra* and *calculus* from the 2-D Euclidean plane and 3-D space to spaces with any finite or infinite number of dimensions.

A *Hilbert space* is an *abstract vector space* possessing the structure of an inner product that allows length and angle to be measured.

* **qubit** :

The basic unit of quantum information is called **qubit**, and a machine for storing and processing qubits is called a **quantum computer**.

* **superposition** :

Qubits can be in the "$|0>$" state (called a zero-ket), the "$|1>$" state (called the one-ket), or both at once (superposition).

The half angle bracket notation $|>$ is conventionally used to indicate *qubits*, as opposed to ordinary bits.

When you measure the $|0>$ quantum state, you get a classical 0, and when you measure the $|1>$ quantum state, you get a classical 1. The $|0>$ state is sometimes called the ground state because in many physical implementations of quantum computing, including IBM's, it is the lowest energy state.

* **entanglement**

Entanglement is a very particular type of quantum superposition and does not have a classical analog.

In an entangled state, the whole system is in a definite state, even though the parts are not.

Observing one of 2 entangled qubits causes it to behave randomly, but tells the observer exactly how the other qubit would act if a similar observation were made on it. This is because entanglement involves a correlation between individually random behaviours of the 2 qubits, it cannot be used to send a message.
