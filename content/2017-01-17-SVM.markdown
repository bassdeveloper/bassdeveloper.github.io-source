# SVM

> The main goal in SVM is to design a hyperplane that classifies all training vectors in 2 classes.

* **SVM needs training data thus comes under supervised learning**.
* **SVM is a classification algorithm**

### Example :
![SVM_Training]({filename}/assets/2017-01-17-SVM-e7301.png)

* We have plotted the size and weight of several people, and there is also a way to distinguish between men and women.

With such data, using a SVM will allow us to answer the following question:

> Given a particular data point (weight and size), is the person a man or a woman ?

* For instance:  if someone measures 175 cm and weights 80 kg, is it a man of a woman?



## Hyperplane

In geometry, a hyperplane is a **subspace of one dimension less than its ambient space**.

Example :

  * If a space is 3-dimensional then its hyperplanes are the 2-dimensional planes, while

  * If the space is 2-dimensional, its hyperplanes are the 1-dimensional lines.

This notion can be used in any general space in which the concept of the dimension of a subspace is defined.

##  Maximum margin?

Now the following problem exists :

> There can be 'n' number of hyperplanes that can be drawn that separate both our classes.

**But SVM's goal is to get the hyperplane that leaves the maximum margin from both classes ( i.e. the best choice )**

Thus, we arrive at the term : `Maximum Margin Hyperplane`.

**The Optimal HyperPlane is a no man's land.**

* **This means that the optimal hyperplane will be the one with the biggest margin.**

*That is why the objective of the SVM is to find  the optimal separating hyperplane which maximizes the margin of the training data.*

## How to Calculate this margin?

### What is a vector ?

If we define a point $A(3,4)$ in $\Re^2$, we can plot it like this :

![2D_point]({filename}/assets/2017-01-17-SVM-6c98b.png)

> Definition: Any point $x=(x1,x2),x\ne0$, in $\Re^2$,$\Re^2$ specifies a vector in the plane, namely the vector starting at the origin and ending at $x$.

Equations for the hyperplane :
$$g(\vec{x}) = w^T\vec{x}+w_0$$
