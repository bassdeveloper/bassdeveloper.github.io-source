<p>Disclaimer : This blog represents my feelings and the way I feel about certain things. I need to understand some of the incidents that happen in my life and I would like to blog about it. I may be wrong and my mind is exploring both sides of the game. The game of life! I believe in learning from my own mistakes and taking my own calls. I am not a rebel. I wish to understand things within and things that have led to me being here. Most of all, I consider this as my way of talking to my own self and clearing my thoughts.</p>

<h1>The Uprising</h1>
<p>Independence Struggle was something that was an essential and burnt into the minds of everybody that has come from the lands that fought for the same valiantly. What is freedom ? What is the truest sense of freedom ?</p>
<p>To understand the truest sense of freedom, we would need to understand what was defined as a violation of it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Justification of unjust, unfair, unscrupulous (having no morals) and outright foul events.</li>
<li>When the people who should've been protecting the justice, violate it.</li>
<li>When you are forced to commit to something you don't believe in ( e.g. Linguistic Chauvinism in the Last Lesson ).</li>
<li>To follow people who have wronged you and to be part of a flawed system.</li>
</ul>
<p>You feel frustrated and find means to fulfill what you feel is right.</p>
<h2>Armed Uprising</h2>
<p>People started giving in/bringing in fire-arms and practicing firearms. The people had started realizing that freedom was necessary and started feeling the need to fight.</p>
<h2>What has History remembered?</h2>
<p>History recorded that an uprising had been caused by small children who were all under or around 20 years of age. An average age below 18 years. They all had found a leader in one person - <strong>Masterda Surya Sen</strong>. What had the children, the teenage boys seen in this man ? What motivated these children to join and follow a rebel? These teenagers, these boys had no idea of what the big picture was or maybe they had. But at that age, it would be wrong to assume that children were mature enought to know what they were doing.</p>
<p>The uprising was a success and these boys had become men</p>
