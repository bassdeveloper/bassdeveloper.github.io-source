3.4
1 behavior
external appearance or action
3.4.1
1 implementation-defined behavior
unspecified behavior where each implementation documents how the choice is made
2 EXAMPLE An example of implementation-defined behavior is the propagation of the high-order bit
when a signed integer is shifted right.
3.4.2
1 locale-specific behavior
behavior that depends on local conventions of nationality, culture, and language that each
implementation documents
§3.4.2 General 3
ISO/IEC 9899:201x Committee Draft — April 12, 2011 N1570
2 EXAMPLE An example of locale-specific behavior is whether the islower function returns true for
characters other than the 26 lowercase Latin letters.
3.4.3
1 undefined behavior
behavior, upon use of a nonportable or erroneous program construct or of erroneous data,
for which this International Standard imposes no requirements
2 NOTE Possible undefined behavior ranges from ignoring the situation completely with unpredictable
results, to behaving during translation or program execution in a documented manner characteristic of the
environment (with or without the issuance of a diagnostic message), to terminating a translation or
execution (with the issuance of a diagnostic message).
3 EXAMPLE An example of undefined behavior is the behavior on integer overflow.
3.4.4
1 unspecified behavior
use of an unspecified value, or other behavior where this International Standard provides
two or more possibilities and imposes no further requirements on which is chosen in any
instance
2 EXAMPLE An example of unspecified behavior is the order in which the arguments to a function are
evaluated.
3.5
1 bit
unit of data storage in the execution environment large enough to hold an object that may
have one of two values
2 NOTE It need not be possible to express the address of each individual bit of an object.
3.6
1 byte
addressable unit of data storage large enough to hold any member of the basic character
set of the execution environment
2 NOTE 1 It is possible to express the address of each individual byte of an object uniquely.
3 NOTE 2 A byte is composed of a contiguous sequence of bits, the number of which is implementationdefined.
The least significant bit is called the low-order bit; the most significant bit is called the high-order
bit.
3.7
1 character
〈abstract〉 member of a set of elements used for the organization, control, or
representation of data
3.7.1
1 character
single-byte character
〈C〉 bit representation that fits in a byte
4 General §3.7.1
N1570 Committee Draft — April 12, 2011 ISO/IEC 9899:201x
3.7.2
1 multibyte character
sequence of one or more bytes representing a member of the extended character set of
either the source or the execution environment
2 NOTE The extended character set is a superset of the basic character set.
3.7.3
1 wide character
value representable by an object of type wchar_t, capable of representing any character
in the current locale
3.8
1 constraint
restriction, either syntactic or semantic, by which the exposition of language elements is
to be interpreted

particular set of software, running in a particular translation environment under particular
control options, that performs translation of programs for, and supports execution of
functions in, a particular execution environment
3.13
1 implementation limit
restriction imposed upon programs by the implementation
3.14
1 memory location
either an object of scalar type, or a maximal sequence of adjacent bit-fields all having
nonzero width
§3.14 General 5
ISO/IEC 9899:201x Committee Draft — April 12, 2011 N1570
2 NOTE 1 Tw o threads of execution can update and access separate memory locations without interfering
with each other.
3 NOTE 2 A bit-field and an adjacent non-bit-field member are in separate memory locations. The same
applies to two bit-fields, if one is declared inside a nested structure declaration and the other is not, or if the
two are separated by a zero-length bit-field declaration, or if they are separated by a non-bit-field member
declaration. It is not safe to concurrently update two non-atomic bit-fields in the same structure if all
members declared between them are also (non-zero-length) bit-fields, no matter what the sizes of those
intervening bit-fields happen to be.
4 EXAMPLE A structure declared as
struct {
char a;
int b:5, c:11, :0, d:8;
struct { int ee:8; } e;
}
contains four separate memory locations: The member a, and bit-fields d and e.ee are each separate
memory locations, and can be modified concurrently without interfering with each other. The bit-fields b
and c together constitute the fourth memory location. The bit-fields b and c cannot be concurrently
modified, but b and a, for example, can be.
3.15
1 object
region of data storage in the execution environment, the contents of which can represent
values
2 NOTE When referenced, an object may be interpreted as having a particular type; see 6.3.2.1.
3.16
1 parameter
formal parameter
formal argument (deprecated)
object declared as part of a function declaration or definition that acquires a value on
entry to the function, or an identifier from the comma-separated list bounded by the
parentheses immediately following the macro name in a function-like macro definition
3.17
1 recommended practice
specification that is strongly recommended as being in keeping with the intent of the
standard, but that may be impractical for some implementations
3.18
1 runtime-constraint
requirement on a program when calling a library function
2 NOTE 1 Despite the similar terms, a runtime-constraint is not a kind of constraint as defined by 3.8, and
need not be diagnosed at translation time.
3 NOTE 2 Implementations that support the extensions in annex K are required to verify that the runtimeconstraints
for a library function are not violated by the program; see K.3.1.4.
6 General §3.18
N1570 Committee Draft — April 12, 2011 ISO/IEC 9899:201x
3.19
1 value
precise meaning of the contents of an object when interpreted as having a specific type
3.19.1
1 implementation-defined value
unspecified value where each implementation documents how the choice is made
3.19.2
1 indeterminate value
either an unspecified value or a trap representation
3.19.3
1 unspecified value
valid value of the relevant type where this International Standard imposes no
requirements on which value is chosen in any instance
2 NOTE An unspecified value cannot be a trap representation.
3.19.4
1 trap representation
an object representation that need not represent a value of the object type
3.19.5
1 perform a trap
interrupt execution of the program such that no further operations are performed
2 NOTE In this International Standard, when the word ‘‘trap’’ is not immediately followed by
‘‘representation’’, this is the intended usage.2)
3.20
1 ⎡x⎤
ceiling of x: the least integer greater than or equal to x
2 EXAMPLE ⎡2. 4⎤ is 3, ⎡−2. 4⎤ is −2.
3.21
1 ⎣x⎦
floor of x: the greatest integer less than or equal to x
2 EXAMPLE ⎣2. 4⎦ is 2, ⎣−2. 4⎦ is −3.
2) For example, ‘‘Trapping or stopping (if supported) is disabled...’’ (F.8.2). Note that fetching a trap
representation might perform a trap but is not required to (see 6.2.6.1).
§3.21 General 7
ISO/IEC 9899:201x Committee Draft — April 12, 2011 N1570
4. Conformance
1 In this International Standard, ‘‘shall’’ is to be interpreted as a requirement on an
implementation or on a program; conversely, ‘‘shall not’’ is to be interpreted as a
prohibition.
2 If a ‘‘shall’’ or ‘‘shall not’’ requirement that appears outside of a constraint or runtimeconstraint
is violated, the behavior is undefined. Undefined behavior is otherwise
indicated in this International Standard by the words ‘‘undefined behavior’’ or by the
omission of any explicit definition of behavior. There is no difference in emphasis among
these three; they all describe ‘‘behavior that is undefined’’.
3 A program that is correct in all other aspects, operating on correct data, containing
unspecified behavior shall be a correct program and act in accordance with 5.1.2.3.
4 The implementation shall not successfully translate a preprocessing translation unit
containing a #error preprocessing directive unless it is part of a group skipped by
conditional inclusion.
5 A strictly conforming program shall use only those features of the language and library
specified in this International Standard.3) It shall not produce output dependent on any
unspecified, undefined, or implementation-defined behavior, and shall not exceed any
minimum implementation limit.
6 The two forms of conforming implementation are hosted and freestanding. A conforming
hosted implementation shall accept any strictly conforming program. A conforming
freestanding implementation shall accept any strictly conforming program in which the ∗
use of the features specified in the library clause (clause 7) is confined to the contents of
the standard headers <float.h>, <iso646.h>, <limits.h>, <stdalign.h>,
<stdarg.h>, <stdbool.h>, <stddef.h>, <stdint.h>, and
<stdnoreturn.h>. A conforming implementation may have extensions (including
additional library functions), provided they do not alter the behavior of any strictly
conforming program.4)
3) A strictly conforming program can use conditional features (see 6.10.8.3) provided the use is guarded
by an appropriate conditional inclusion preprocessing directive using the related macro. For example:</p>
<h1>ifdef _ <em>STDC_IEC_559</em> _ /<em> FE_UPWARD defined </em>/</h1>
<p>/<em> ... </em>/
fesetround(FE_UPWARD);
/<em> ... </em>/</p>
<h1>endif</h1>
<p>4) This implies that a conforming implementation reserves no identifiers other than those explicitly
reserved in this International Standard.
8 General §4
N1570 Committee Draft — April 12, 2011 ISO/IEC 9899:201x
7 A conforming program is one that is acceptable to a conforming implementation.5)
8 An implementation shall be accompanied by a document that defines all implementationdefined
and locale-specific characteristics and all extensions.
Forward references: conditional inclusion (6.10.1), error directive (6.10.5),
characteristics of floating types <float.h> (7.7), alternative spellings <iso646.h>
(7.9), sizes of integer types <limits.h> (7.10), alignment <stdalign.h> (7.15),
variable arguments <stdarg.h> (7.16), boolean type and values <stdbool.h>
(7.18), common definitions <stddef.h> (7.19), integer types <stdint.h> (7.20),
<stdnoreturn.h> (7.23).
5) Strictly conforming programs are intended to be maximally portable among conforming
implementations. Conforming programs may depend upon nonportable features of a conforming
implementation.
§4 General 9
ISO/IEC 9899:201x Committee Draft — April 12, 2011 N1570
5. Environment
1 An implementation translates C source files and executes C programs in two dataprocessing-system
environments, which will be called the translation environment and
the execution environment in this International Standard. Their characteristics define and
constrain the results of executing conforming C programs constructed according to the
syntactic and semantic rules for conforming implementations.
Forward references: In this clause, only a few of many possible forward references
have been noted.
5.1 Conceptual models
5.1.1 Translation environment
5.1.1.1 Program structure
1 A C program need not all be translated at the same time. The text of the program is kept
in units called source files, (or preprocessing files) in this International Standard. A
source file together with all the headers and source files included via the preprocessing
directive #include is known as a preprocessing translation unit. After preprocessing, a
preprocessing translation unit is called a translation unit. Previously translated translation
units may be preserved individually or in libraries. The separate translation units of a
program communicate by (for example) calls to functions whose identifiers have external
linkage, manipulation of objects whose identifiers have external linkage, or manipulation
of data files. Translation units may be separately translated and then later linked to
produce an executable program.
Forward references: linkages of identifiers (6.2.2), external definitions (6.9),
preprocessing directives (6.10).
5.1.1.2 Translation phases
1 The precedence among the syntax rules of translation is specified by the following
phases.6)
1. Physical source file multibyte characters are mapped, in an implementationdefined
manner, to the source character set (introducing new-line characters for
end-of-line indicators) if necessary. Trigraph sequences are replaced by
corresponding single-character internal representations.
6) Implementations shall behave as if these separate phases occur, even though many are typically folded
together in practice. Source files, translation units, and translated translation units need not
necessarily be stored as files, nor need there be any one-to-one correspondence between these entities
and any external representation. The description is conceptual only, and does not specify any
particular implementation.
10 Environment §5.1.1.2
N1570 Committee Draft — April 12, 2011 ISO/IEC 9899:201x
2. Each instance of a backslash character () immediately followed by a new-line
character is deleted, splicing physical source lines to form logical source lines.
Only the last backslash on any physical source line shall be eligible for being part
of such a splice. A source file that is not empty shall end in a new-line character,
which shall not be immediately preceded by a backslash character before any such
splicing takes place.
3. The source file is decomposed into preprocessing tokens7) and sequences of
white-space characters (including comments). A source file shall not end in a
partial preprocessing token or in a partial comment. Each comment is replaced by
one space character. New-line characters are retained. Whether each nonempty
sequence of white-space characters other than new-line is retained or replaced by
one space character is implementation-defined.
4. Preprocessing directives are executed, macro invocations are expanded, and
_Pragma unary operator expressions are executed. If a character sequence that
matches the syntax of a universal character name is produced by token
concatenation (6.10.3.3), the behavior is undefined. A #include preprocessing
directive causes the named header or source file to be processed from phase 1
through phase 4, recursively. All preprocessing directives are then deleted.
5. Each source character set member and escape sequence in character constants and
string literals is converted to the corresponding member of the execution character
set; if there is no corresponding member, it is converted to an implementationdefined
member other than the null (wide) character.8)
6. Adjacent string literal tokens are concatenated.
7. White-space characters separating tokens are no longer significant. Each
preprocessing token is converted into a token. The resulting tokens are
syntactically and semantically analyzed and translated as a translation unit.
8. All external object and function references are resolved. Library components are
linked to satisfy external references to functions and objects not defined in the
current translation. All such translator output is collected into a program image
which contains information needed for execution in its execution environment.
Forward references: universal character names (6.4.3), lexical elements (6.4),
preprocessing directives (6.10), trigraph sequences (5.2.1.1), external definitions (6.9).
7) As described in 6.4, the process of dividing a source file’s characters into preprocessing tokens is
context-dependent. For example, see the handling of &lt; within a #include preprocessing directive.
8) An implementation need not convert all non-corresponding source characters to the same execution
character.</p>                </article>
